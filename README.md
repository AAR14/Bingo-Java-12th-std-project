# Hey there!
# This was my 12th grade Computer project. It is a simple BINGO game that the user can play with the computer to while away some free time.
# The concept for this game is as follows:
# ~The user and the computer generate a 5X5 matrix of number ranging 1-25 that are arranged in a random order. Each row and column represents the letters of the word 'BINGO' in the same order.
# ~The user and the computer take turns to pick a number in random.
# ~Both, the user and the computer strike off the choosen number from their lists. On completely striking of elements of row or column completely, they earn the letter that represents the respective row or column.
# ~The first one to earn all the letters of the word 'BINGO' win the game.
